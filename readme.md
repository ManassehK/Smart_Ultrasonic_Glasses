# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This is an 'Ultrasonic Glasses' made for blind people. These glasses can
detect object from a range of 1.5m and specific beeps also occur
depending upon the range of the object.
After making the circuit and testing it out, you can attach this to your
sunglasses(the one you don't use now) 
I did not use Arduino Nano because it's not working properly and I don't have a 
Arduino Pro mini. Still, Uno works!

Here are the signals:-
1) Buzzer beeps in the interval of 2 sec when object in between 1.5m to 1.2m
2) Buzzer beeps in the interval of 1.4 sec when object in between 1.2m to 80cm
3) Buzzer beeps in the interval of 0.9 sec when object in between 80cm to 50cm
4) Buzzer beeps in the interval of 0.1 sec when object in between 50cm to 25cm
5) Buzzer just beeps continously when object is under 25cm
